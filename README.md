# 💥 LeetCode & Codewars Solutions

Welcome to my repository where I solve **LeetCode** challenges. I am currently  using **Python** 🐍 and **Java** ☕️. This repository is a collection of algorithms and data structure problems aimed at improving coding skills, enhancing problem-solving abilities, and sharpening my grasp of data structures and algorithms.

## 🗃️ Repository Structure

The repository is organized by problem type and platform for easier navigation. Each solution contains the problem solution and sometimes explanations for tricky or interesting problems.


### 📂 Folder Details:

Each folder contains solutions in their respective language. All problems are labeled by their number with leading zeros for sorting.

## 🖥️ Platform

### [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)
LeetCode is the tried and true place for interview coding problems. It offers a vast collection of problems that range from basic to advanced levels, testing algorithmic skills and knowledge of data structures.

## 📂 Languages

### Python 🐍
Python is many people's first choice in solving interview problems. As such, I want to build my skills in this langauge so I can implements solutions in Python quickly and efficiently. 

### Java ☕️
Java is an object oriented programming language focusing on scalability, modularity, and security. It is excellent for large-scale projects. Thus, I want to sharpen my Java instincts. 

## ⛳️ Future Goals 

- [ ] Solve problems from [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/)
- [ ] Add JavaScript
- [ ] Add C/C++
- [ ] Add a counter (push action?) to update the number of problems solved in the readme
